            Everyone has experienced anxiety at some point. Although some amount of anxiety is normal, 
            even helpful, too much anxiety can stop us from living the life that we want to live. 
            When we get to the point where we feel that anxiety is making our choices for us, it can 
            be helpful to seek out help.

            One of the most effective tools we have for fighting anxiety is exposure therapy, but it 
            can be difficult to access. Our mission is to put the power of exposure 
            therapy at your fingertips.

            We have created this tool in the hopes that it will help 
            people who are interested in tackling a fear using evidence-based practices. We also 
            hope that our platform can be a helpful tool for clinicians who are interested in integrating 
            exposure therapy into their work.
